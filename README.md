# Installation
1. Install neovim
2. Create nvim folder if not already present
3. Put contents of this repo in nvim folder
4. Run nvim.

LazyVim should automatically run and start installing packages.
This config comes with <leader> set to <space>, and some which_keys bindings enabled.
Press <space> and wait a second to see the enabled bindings.
<space> + fb is bound to Telescope's file browser.

There's probably some other stuff but I can't remember right now.
