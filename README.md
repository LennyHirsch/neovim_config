# Installation
1. Install neovim
2. Create nvim folder if not already present
3. Put contents of this repo in nvim folder
4. Run nvim.

LazyVim should automatically run and start installing packages. After initial installation, LazyVim window can be accessed with command :Lazy.

This config comes with <leader> set to <space>, and some which_keys bindings enabled.
Press <space> and wait a second to see the enabled bindings.
<space> + fb is bound to Telescope's file browser.

To set up LSPs, DAPs, etc. you can run :Mason to open the Mason UI and install/manage servers from here.

There's probably some other stuff but I can't remember right now.
